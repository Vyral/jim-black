There is a huge difference between hiring a team of agents to sell your home as opposed to working with a solo Realtor.

Take the Jim Black Group, for example. **We’ve got a team of nine experienced professionals all working on behalf of you, our clients, to best serve your needs.** By working collaboratively, we’re each able to focus on our strength, while simultaneously ensuring that someone is always available to help you. In short, by hiring us you get nine agents for the price of one.

Not only do we have team members solely focused on the sale of your home, but we also have a photographer, a stager, a transaction coordinator, and a marketing manager—all working together to make sure your listing experience is smooth and successful.

Think of it this way: Imagine if you went to the dentist only to find that the person who cleans your teeth was the same person responsible for everything else that went on in their office. Obviously, this would cause issues. When you seek out professional services, you should expect to be taken care of—**not to wait around while one person tries to juggle everything that goes into your experience.**

The bottom line is this: Don’t settle for less than you deserve. Work with an experienced team, and safeguard your success.
