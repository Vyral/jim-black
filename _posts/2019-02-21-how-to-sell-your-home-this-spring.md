We’re only a month away from the start of our spring market, so if you’ve been thinking of selling in this hot upcoming season, you need to be talking with an agent now.

We’ll already be meeting with clients throughout the next week or two in order to get them ready to sell next month. **They’ll be told what repairs they need to make and the updates that must be done in order to get their homes sold for top dollar.**

Next, we’ll bring out our home stager, who will guide them on how to position their furniture, show them the best colors for paint, and help them declutter and get rid of extraneous items. After all, you’re selling the home, not your personal belongings.

Finally, we’ll bring a professional photographer to get great shots of the home. These pictures will help it stand out on the market.

**So, what can you do right now?** Start decluttering and give your agent a call. If you want to sell this spring, make the phone call so they can get you on the right track toward making top dollar for your home.

If you’d like our guidance, have any questions, or need further information, feel free to reach out to us. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
