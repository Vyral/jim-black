When putting your home on the market, it’s important to not be led astray by common seller practices that will likely only hurt your sale in the end.&nbsp;

Today I’ll give you, the seller, a little insight into **what you should—and shouldn’t—do if you want to net a higher sale price on your home. &nbsp;**

There’s a belief among sellers that you should refrain from listing your home until a certain time of year. In reality, it’s less about the time of year and more about the level of inventory at a particular time. **Look at when the market’s inventory is lowest to ensure you’re getting the most money possible, rather than simply relying on the season.&nbsp;**

Some sellers are intent on listing their home as is, but this is another approach that you’d do well to avoid. If you were to leave a $5,000 repair unaddressed, for instance, you’re running the risk of potentially leaving $50,000 on the table. **Make home repairs such as this a priority when getting your home market-ready.** You might even be able to wait until closing to pay the repair costs. &nbsp; &nbsp;

During a conversation with a seller recently, they asked me if they could leave room for negotiation in pricing their home. But **by pricing and presenting your home correctly right from the outset, you can rest assured that buyers will pay the price that you set and it may even spur a multiple-offer situation. &nbsp;**

Lastly, you want to **make sure your home shows in its best light, which is achieved by professional staging and photography.&nbsp;**

Don’t make the mistake of jumping into the market without making sure you’ve first crossed your t’s and dotted your i’s just because of the time of year. After all, the best time to sell your home is when it’s ready.&nbsp;
