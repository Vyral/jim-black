{% include youtube.html %}<br><br>There are a few specific reasons why you absolutely don’t want to overprice your home. **For starters, you'll end up selling your home for less money.&nbsp;**

Let's say your home is worth $300,000 and we decide to list it for $320,000. This results in us ruling out all the buyers who are looking up to $300,000 for a home, and by the time you’ve hit your third or fourth week on the market, people will start thinking there is something wrong with the house and buyers will have already moved on.

**It’s important to price a home where you expect it to sell.** This ensures that you'll get the most money possible for the house. Pricing appropriately will help you get the upper hand in negotiations because you know what the home is worth and what you want to sell it for.<br><br>{% include pullquote.html %}

Having an agent who understands the past, present, and future of the market is key. You can’t always just look at what has been selling to determine where to price a home. You need the full picture of the data, which your agent should have.

**Pricing your home too high is a dangerous, ineffective home selling strategy.** If you have any questions for us about the right way to sell a home or anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
