When you’re competing against five, 10, or even 15 other offers on a home you love, it can be an unnerving experience. Thankfully, you can easily win in any multiple-offer situation by following a few key steps.

**First, find out what the seller wants.** Do they want to close quickly? Do they want to earn top dollar? Understanding their priority will help you to craft the most effective possible deal. The agent you work with must be assertive enough to uncover the seller’s priorities, and to help you develop a plan with those priorities in mind.&nbsp;

**Next, make sure that you don’t ask for the seller to include items they aren’t willing to part with.** If they’ve already said that the washer and dryer will be going with them when they move, don’t try to change their mind. Doing so could make them feel insulted.&nbsp;

**Finally, you need to move quickly.** Submit your highest and best offer from the start, as this will greatly increase your chances of catching the seller’s attention.&nbsp;

If you follow each of these steps, your offer is sure to stand out from the rest.

As always, if you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
