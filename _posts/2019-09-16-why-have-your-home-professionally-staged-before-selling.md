What is staging and how does it help your home sale?&nbsp;

**Staging is the process by which you prepare your home for the market.** Your preparation will consist of everything from cleaning and packing to painting and putting in new carpet. Beyond those to-do items, though, how will you know what needs to be done? This is where a professional stager comes in.&nbsp;

Turning our attention to the importance of staging, consider these statistics from the National Association of Realtors’ [2019 Profile of Home Staging:&nbsp;](https://www.nar.realtor/research-and-statistics/research-reports/profile-of-home-staging){: target="_blank"}

1\. 53% of seller’s agents say that staging decreases the amount of time a home spends on the market.

2\. 83% of buyer’s agents say that staging made it easier for buyers to visualize the property as their future home.

3\. 44% of buyer’s agents say that staging increases the dollar value their buyer is willing to offer.
