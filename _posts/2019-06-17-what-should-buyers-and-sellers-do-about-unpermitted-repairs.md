Whether you’re a buyer or a seller, it’s important to know whether all the work that’s been done to the property in question has been done through the proper legal channels. If the square footage in the home seems higher than what was reported on the MLS, for example, this is definitely something you should look into.&nbsp;

So, what can you do if you suspect there have been unpermitted upgrades or repairs made to a property? The first step is to go to your local town hall and check the home’s records. This will show you what permitted work has been done. If you don’t catch these issues yourself, it’s very likely that the inspector or appraiser will.&nbsp;

Ultimately, **it’s much easier to avoid permit-related issues ahead of time by taking the proper steps whenever you make an upgrade or repair than it is to resolve such problems after the fact.&nbsp;**

If you know that your home, or the home you’re buying, has had unpermitted work done, tell your Realtor as soon as possible. They will be able to advise you on how to proceed.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
