A lot of changes have taken place in the Worcester County real estate market over the last year, so let’s review a few of the most notable developments.

First of all, inventory has dropped 14.3% since last October, but this is only true of our market, in general. In certain price ranges, like the range between $450,000 to $600,000, inventory actually rose—in the case of this specific price range, supply rose 17.4%.&nbsp;

On another note, **interest rates continue to remain well below 4%, and the average sales price for our area has risen 4% year over year.&nbsp;**

However, despite our low inventory and favorable rates, the average number of days it’s taken for homes to receive an offer has crept up by 5.1% year over year. Overall sales, meanwhile, dropped 4.2%.&nbsp;

The bottom line is that buyers and sellers alike now have the chance to earn a great deal, as **low interest rates translate to higher purchasing power for buyers and low inventory translates to reduced competition for sellers.&nbsp;**

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
