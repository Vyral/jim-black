Of the five most common mistakes that first-time homebuyers make (but should avoid), some seem pretty obvious, but others aren’t quite as apparent:

**1\. Failing to get pre-approved before house-hunting.** One of the worst things that could happen to a homebuyer is falling in love with a home, only to have to wait 72 hours for a lender to give you a pre-approval letter before you can make an offer on it. In that time, someone else could make a move on the home, or worse, you could find out that you don’t qualify for it.<br><br>**2\. Calling the listing agent.** If you call a listing agent directly, you’ll probably end up giving them information that you shouldn’t. That agent doesn’t represent you or your interests; you should be contacting a buyer’s agent to stand in your corner as you go through the process.<br><br>**3\. Not doing a buyer consultation.** If you sit down for a formal consultation with a buyer’s agent, they’ll get to know you, your wants, and your needs. That will make sure that you don’t end up wasting your time looking at houses that don’t fit your criteria.

Not understanding the market.** Many people are still shaken from the crash in the late 2000s when the market was dropping and buyers were making offers under asking price. However, that doesn’t happen so much today. Houses are selling quickly and for 99% or more of their list price, some with multiple offers. Make sure that your agent understands the market and does a market analysis on the homes you’re interested in so that you’re prepared to put your best foot forward.<br><br>**5\. Searching for homes online.** There are many websites on the internet where you can browse homes. However, doing only that might mean you’ll miss the perfect home. Why? Because a lot of popular sites like Zillow have a lag—you might stumble across a home you love only to find out that it’s already sold. To make sure that you get the first opportunity to make a move on a home, have your agent send you direct MLS listings. With our MLS system, we can send you automatic updates every 15 minutes so you’ll see properties before anyone else. In this market, it’s important to get in there as fast as possible.
