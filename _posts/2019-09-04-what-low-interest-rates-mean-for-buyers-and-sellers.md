We have some exciting news to share with you today. **Interest rates are at an all-time low right now.** For homebuyers, this means that you can afford a lot more house than you could have in the past. You might even be able to afford that dream home now.

This news is good for sellers as well. **With rates so low, a lot more buyers will continue to come looking for homes in the market.** There simply isn’t enough inventory for all of them, so you can get a great price for your property.
