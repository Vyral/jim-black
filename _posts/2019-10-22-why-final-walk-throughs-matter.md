Buyers sometimes ask me why the final walk-through matters. Sometimes, people falsely assume that this process is yet another home inspection, but this isn’t the case.&nbsp;

The point of a final walk-through is to ensure that the property is in condition the buyer and seller have agreed upon per their purchase contract. **The final walk-through allows buyers to verify that all promised repairs were made, all items that come with the home have been left in place, and that no new damage has occurred.**

No one wants to move into a property only to discover the hot water no longer works or that the refrigerator you promised has been hauled away. This is why the final walk-through, which should be completed as close to closing as possible, is so important. **Generally, it’s best to schedule it within the 24 hours leading up to closing.** This way, there’s very little chance that something might go amiss after the final walk-through is already done.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
