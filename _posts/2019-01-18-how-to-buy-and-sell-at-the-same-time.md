What happens if you need to sell your current home and buy your next at the same time? There are actually three routes you can take when faced with this scenario: Buy and then sell, sell and then buy, or do both simultaneously.

**Before you settle on one of these three options, you will need to get your finances in order.** This will involve steps like getting pre-approved by a lender and having your agent assess the amount of equity you can leverage into your purchase. After this, you can move on with your transactions.

There are unique advantages and disadvantages to each of the options we covered.

**Buying before you sell allows you to conduct your search without the additional stress that comes along with listing.** However, it also means that you donâ€™t yet have the earnings from your sale to use toward your purchase. It also means you may temporarily be stuck with two mortgages.

**If you choose to sell first, you will benefit from having the money from your sale available to use toward your next home.** The drawback to this option is that you may need to find temporary housing while you look for your next property.

The last option, buying and selling simultaneously, is something our team has helped many clients achieve. We can help you find a ready, willing, and able buyer for your current home first, and then assist you in getting started on your search **so that you can close both transactions on the same day.**
