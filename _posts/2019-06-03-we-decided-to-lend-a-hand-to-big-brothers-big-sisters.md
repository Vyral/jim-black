Why do we give back?

I believe that if we have enough, we should help others, and we at Keller Williams Realty Pinnacle Central have decided to do this in a couple of ways.&nbsp;

One of which is through the Big Brothers Big Sisters organization. The mentors in this organization are changing kids’ lives for the better, free of charge. After I attended one of their events, it touched my heart, and I knew that it was where I wanted to give back.

With that in mind, we partnered with them and created the “Closings for Kids” program, where we donate a portion of every dollar we earn from each home we close on. We’ve also had clients chip in and donate along with us.&nbsp;

**If you’d like to make a donation to this program and lend a hand to a local organization that’s committed to giving back to our community,&nbsp;**[click on this link.](https://bbbscm.org/closings-for-kids){: target="_blank"} It’s a great cause, and I’ve watched it change lives.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about this program, feel free to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
