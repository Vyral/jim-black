As a home seller, here are the five questions you must ask each agent you interview before you hire them:&nbsp;

**1. Do you work independently or as part of a team?** When you meet with an agent face to face, are they picking up their phone every time it rings? If they’re a part of a team, they’ll most likely have someone back at their office answering calls for them, which gives them more time to devote to you.&nbsp;

**2. What kind of experience do you have?** In asking this, you’re not referring to how many years they’ve been in the business, but rather how many homes they’ve sold in the last, say, five years.&nbsp;

**3. What will I net from the home sale?** Just because you know your home is worth, for example, $300,000, it doesn’t mean that’s the amount you’ll get when you sell it—you still have to pay the Realtor’s commission and other assorted fees. For this reason, you should ask your agent to take these factors into consideration and calculate what you can expect to net from your sale.&nbsp;

**4. Can I see a list of references?** A good agent should have a ready-made list of references who are willing to vouch for them and their level of service.&nbsp;

**5. Can I see your statistics?** Are they selling homes quicker and for a higher price than the average agent? Have them show you their MLS statistics so you can compare them against the field.&nbsp;

Asking these questions will help you make the right hire and help your home sell quickly and for top dollar.&nbsp;
